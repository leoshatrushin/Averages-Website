	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<br>
	<h4>How do I input my results?</h4>
	<p>The form to input results can be found in a link under the four boxes on the left of the graph under the "Me" page of each subject.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>What is the point of this website?</h4>
	<p>Have you ever thought it was messy and time consuming to generate graphs, statistics or calculate results in random places on a spreadsheet, or wondered why we get interim task reports for methods and specialist but not any other subject? <u>You don't have to be competitive to use this website!</u> This website can merely serve as a convenient, easy-to-use and useful method of tracking your results, so you never have to wait for task reports or ask for your average again. And there are of course extra features available that the school system or a spreadsheet will not give you, not only ready-made graphs and predictions, but seeing the results of others can help you determine your rank and better ascertain your progress to help ensure success in your school year. This website not only helps to determine your ranking, but also how far ahead or behind you are in relation to everyone else, and by how much those gaps are closing or widening, which can help you obtain that spark of motivation to decrease/increase them, all while helping you to have friendly, respectful and ultimately enjoyable competitive relations with others.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Is there an option to make my results anonymous?</h4>
	<p><b>Not at the moment, no.</b> We are still developing the main functionality of the website, but this is our next <b>top priority.</b> It is very important to us that you feel comfortable using our website, so we plan to add a comprehensive range of options, including filtering which results will show up or be associated with your name by subject, test and value. There will also be a full anonymity option as well as blocking certain people from seeing your results and a 'friends list' of people which can see extra results. We would like everyone to be able to use the website in a way that works for them while still contributing to the overall statistics.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>What's stopping people from faking their results?</h4>
	<p>It is very important to us that the results and statistics on our website are accurate. As a result we have several ideas in place to limit the number of fake results being entered. Our system to verify users will consist of accounts requiring a valid student.education.wa.edu.au email and then requiring them to send an email back with the copied link to the year 12 connect page. This will make sure that one person can only create one account and that they are from Perth Modern. New users will be monitored by an administrator for an undisclosed time period. There will be a limit implemented on how many times you can change the results for a test, with additional changed needing approval from an administrator. Additionally, there will be undisclosed methods to detect users which could potentially input false results or results which seem false. A digital currency for reputation will be implemented so that you know whether to trust the results inputted by users. Reputations below a certain value will mean results will no longer contribute to statistics.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>How are the maximum possible and predicted averages be calculated?</h4>
	<p>The maximum possible average you can get is if you get 100% in all of the remaining assessments, so good luck with that! For predicted average the method we chose is to find the line of best fit of your averages after each assessment, and see where that line ends up by the last assessment. Note that this is very likely inaccurate (can go above 100% and below 0%), but its value compared with your current average can help determine the trend of your results - whether they are improving or not and by how much. In the future we will implement a more accurate method taking into account weightings and moving trendlines into account.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Will the website always be free to use?</h4>
	<p><u><b>Yes!</b></u> The core functionality of the website will always be available to all free of charge, to help expand the number of users and give your statistics greater accuracy. However for those of you who love looking at statistics, we plan to make a yearly subscription plan where you'll be able to enjoy a mass variety of graphs, probability calculations and expected result calculations, as well as graphics customisation options for your profile and how you appear on tables.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Who do I contact to report an issue or give a suggestion?</h4>

We really appreciate any suggestions you have for us or any details of your experience you wish to share and will actively consider your thoughts to try and improve our website so you have a better experience.</p>
